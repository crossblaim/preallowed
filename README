== DESCRIPTION:
====================================================================
Distributed Role-Based Access Control Service -- Restful authorization

The service is provided at http://preallowed.com

The source code for the service can be obtained at http://github.com/dmitryame/preallowed/tree/master , feel free to install and use the service on your local infrastructure if that's what you need.


== FEATURES:
====================================================================
* Use Preallowed to implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for your applications.
* Preallowed is implemented as a RESTful web service, thus easiest to be accessed from any Ruby on Rails application via Active Resource. See examples at http://www.preallowed.com/home/help 
* The service can be access from any language that supports http API. We've tested it with Java, but other languages like C++, C#, Basic, Perl, etc... should work as well.
* The source code has complete test coverage. 


== INSTALL
====================================================================
* Install rails 2.0.1 or later
* Obtain a source code from github http://github.com/dmitryame/preallowed/tree/master
* Copy ./config/database.yml.example to ./config/database.yml               
* Copy ./config/environment.rb.example to ./config/environment.rb  (the copied files from 2 last steps will not be versioned, so feel free to tune them up according to your needs)
* Run following commands
	rake db:create:all
	rake db:migrate
	./script/populate_dev # you might have to give it exec permissions (chmod +x ./script/populate_dev)
* Run autotest or rake to make sure all the tests pass -- this is a good indication that the install was successful.
